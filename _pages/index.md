title: "About me"
---

I am a Research Assistant at the [Computer Lab](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) of the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), working with [Prof. Jamie Vicary](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jv258/). My research interests lie in the intersection of mathematics and theoretical computer science. I am working on higher category theory using ideas from logic and dependent type theory. I am interested in applications of higher categories to topology and to the semantics of programming languages. Moreover, I am interested in the homotopy theory of higher categories, in particular the comparison of different models, and the homotopy hypothesis for globular models.
