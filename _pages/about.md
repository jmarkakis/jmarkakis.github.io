I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) of the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) supervised by Prof. [Jamie Vicary](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jv258/). My research lies in higher category theory, and more specifically in the theory of computads and type-theoretic presentations of them. For my studies, I hold a scholarship from the [Onassis Foundation](https://www.onassis.org/).
